  <h3>Pee Buddies!</h3>

  <div>
    <p>We are Grace and Katie. We met 3 weeks ago on the second day of the Girls Who Code program.
    <br>
    <br>
    After our friendship <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">sprouted</a>, we decided to participate in various activities together,
    including peeing, switching shoes, and trading sweaters. We also occasionally lick each
    other, but we're both very sanitary so it's fine!
    <br>
    <br>
    We're beginning a vlog channel, and we hope that you can go check it out!

  <h3>Etymology of the term "Pee Buddies"</h3>
  <div id="col">
  <p>After we began using the bathroom together, we established that our relationship status was "Pee Buddies."
  <br>
  <br>
  We also began calling ourselves "Two Peas in a Pod," which made the term "Pee Buddies" even funnier.
